This Repository is the representation of the project that I have done using the Actix web and SQLx.

To start this project, you need to run the following commands:
```make postgres```
--- This command will pull the postgres image from docker hub and run it.

```make createdb```
--- This command will create the database.

```make insert```
--- This command will insert the data into the database.

```make run```
--- This command will run the project on localhost:3000.
